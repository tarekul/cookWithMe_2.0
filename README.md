This application is mobile responsive platform for people to share their favorite recipes with the world. Signed up users can save their favorite recipes to cook later as well as add ingredients to their grocery list for shopping. In the profile users can edit their grocery list as well as add new items. Users can create a mini profile by changing their name and their profile picture. Users can also use cookmode to cook alongside an virtual assistant. Users can interact with the assistant with simple commands such as START, STOP, RESTART, RESUME, NEXT, BACK, LAST in cookmode.
